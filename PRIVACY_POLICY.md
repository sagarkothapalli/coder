# Privacy Policy for Furina Attendance Tracker

**Last Updated:** Tuesday, 10 February 2026

**Furina Attendance Tracker** ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting the privacy of students and educational users. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Android application (the "App").

## 1. Our Privacy Philosophy: "Student First"
The App is designed as a **personal academic productivity tool**. We believe that your academic data belongs to you. Unlike institutional systems, this App is for your personal tracking and does not automatically share your data with universities, professors, or coordinators.

## 2. Information We Collect

### A. Personal Information
- **Account Data:** Name, Email Address, and Password. For Google Sign-In users, we collect the email address and basic profile info provided by Google.
- **Academic Identifiers:** Roll Number, Semester, and Section (used solely for your personal profile).

### B. Educational & Behavioral Data
- **Attendance Records:** Subject names, counts of attended/total/canceled classes, and calculated percentages.
- **Attendance History Logs:** Specific timestamps of when you mark yourself present or absent to generate trend analytics.
- **Performance Data:** SGPA and CGPA records you choose to input for weighted average calculations.
- **Productivity Data:** Task lists and notes created in the "Todo" section.

### C. Technical Data
- **Permissions:** The App requests only `INTERNET` permission for cloud sync. It does **not** access your location, contacts, microphone, or camera.

## 3. How We Use Your Data

- **Service Functionality:** To calculate attendance safety buffers (e.g., "how many classes you can bunk"), visualize SGPA trends, and provide reminders.
- **Cloud Synchronization:** To securely back up your academic records so they are accessible across your devices.
- **Local AI Analysis:** The "AI Assistant" analysis is performed **on-device**. Your specific academic performance metrics are never sent to external AI processing servers.

## 4. Data Sharing and Protection

**We do NOT sell, trade, or rent student data to third parties.**

- **No Targeted Advertising:** We do not use your academic data or behavioral patterns to serve advertisements or for any commercial profiling.
- **No Institutional Sharing:** We do not share your attendance patterns with your educational institution. This is a private tool for your personal use.
- **Third-Party Providers:** We use secure infrastructure (Netlify/Postgres) and Google Auth. These providers process data only to provide the specific services requested by the App.

## 5. Security Measures

- **Encryption:** All data in transit is protected via **HTTPS (TLS/SSL)**.
- **On-Device Security:** Authentication tokens are stored in the **Android Keystore-backed EncryptedSharedPreferences**, preventing access by other apps.
- **Password Safety:** Passwords are salted and hashed; we never store them in plain text.
- **Database Security:** Synced data is stored in a production-grade, firewalled database with restricted access.

## 6. Your Rights & Control

- **Data Access:** You can view all your stored data directly within the App's dashboard and settings.
- **Data Deletion:** You can delete individual subjects, logs, or your entire account at any time. Account deletion permanently removes all your data from our active cloud synchronization servers.
- **Correction:** You have full control to edit any attendance count or CGPA record if you believe it is inaccurate.

## 7. Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)
This App is intended for students in higher education. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not use this App.

## 8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy to reflect new features (like new analytics tools). We will notify you of any significant changes via an in-app notice.
